# danish_health_claims

So far, this project only organizes some claims labels under the data_management folder. The R script there reads in a big excel data set with claim codes, slightly cleans it and (tries to) bring it into normal form.

## Next:
I would like to add a little script to translate the labels from danish to english (probably googletrans in python). 

## Notes
The real data is flying around on a remote server. I would like to use this repo for modeling/simulations and to try out new tools in the future.
