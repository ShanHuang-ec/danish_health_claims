# danish_health_claims

So far, this project only organizes some claims labels under the data_management folder. The R script there (read_data.R) reads in a big excel data set with claim codes (SSSY_documentation.xls), puts everything into the right data types and (tries to) bring it into normal form and saves it.

## Next:
I would like to add a little script to translate the labels from danish to english (probably googletrans in python). 

## Notes
I would like to use this repo for modeling/simulations and to try out new tools in the future.
